# ReinforcementLearning
Jupyter Notebooks on tutorials about Reinforcerment Learning algorithms.

Most of the content put on here was done based on video tutorial from Nicholas Renotte.
This is the link to the video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mut_u40Sqz4

Even though most of the content was based on video tutorials I have put a lot of effort in learning these techniques and algorithms.
On the main notebook I have done some coding of my own, tiny modifications but yet mine ;).
